I had am idea to create a minimal Vue3 theme or template based on the golden ration and other "sacred geometry".  Full disclosure I was inspired by Disney's [*Donald in Mathmagic Land"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl6JDv4ZG7U)

The minimal bit is achieved largely with pico.css 

Feel free to use it if you need to spin up a Vue site quickly and cleanly.

`npm run dev`
`npm run build`
